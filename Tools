#Tools & Resources

##Code Editors

####_Github's Atom_
>My favorite text editors these days, its just so great to use. It is relatively new and has some bugs, but its great to use and also has some awesome packages.

####_Sublime Text_
>My First love before atom was born-Sublime is great, you can almost say Sublime is the father of atom. The problem with Sublime however is the annoying pop ups asking you to buy the editor for $70us which in my opinion is quite expensive.

####_Brackets (from the guys at Adobe)_
>Brackets offers an awesome work-flow for web developers/designers. IMHO the _live reload_ feature should be included in every single code editor out there.

##Graphics

####_Adobe Photoshop_
> Ok! First off, if you never heard of _Photoshop_, just wake up, ok! you're dreaming. Photoshop is a great photo manipulation software that does almost every thing for every one. Im not great at it(I'm not even sure if im good) but I use it for almost every piece of graphic work i have ever owned.

####_Adobe Illustrator_
>Think Photoshop but for logos and branding stuff. I'm still a newbie but it's fun to use.

##Web Services

####_Google Chrome_
>To me the best browser on the planet. It's fast, stable, supports almost every device and most importantly syncs between them all.

####_TuneIn Radio_
>As of to date, in this year ( 2015 ), an FM radio is a waist of electricity so i just don't own one. In fact I hardly listen any radio stations, but when I do I use TuneIn.

####_Youtube_
>Well how else would I get to watch my favorite videos.

####_Behance_
>Behance, is like show and tell for creatives. I'm new to It, but I am using it to showcase all the work found on my "hellofebruary" website.

####_Google Play Music_
>I love, love, love Google Play Music. I listen to music every day, when I'm happy, sad excited or just to kick in my Zen mode while I'm coding I listen to music and Google Play music gives me my fix. **_Fact!!_** I'm actually listening to music as I type this.

####_Google+_
>Great People, Great Place. Google+ is my fantasy island and not the garbage that is facebook. I use Google+ every day to follow people who share my interest and share fun stories.

####_Pinterest_
>I just use it to collect cool stuff I find every where on the web.

##Inspiration
I'm like an addict to great design, yes! its my drug; do not judge me ok! but sometimes when I'm bored I just go window shopping for great design by other folks. I think as designers (especially us beginners), we should really look to those great designers for great examples.

**Here are a few places I go to get my design fix:**
