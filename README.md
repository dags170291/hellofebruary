Dylon Smith portfolio website

About the project
hellofebruary is a portfolio website that I am working on to showcase my work. The website is still very early in development and sure enough has a lot of bugs.There are also some elements that are still work in progress. This is my first Git project and the my first live website, so be patient with me as we learn and develop together.
